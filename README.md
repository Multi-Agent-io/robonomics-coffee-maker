# Robonomics Coffee

## About

"Robonomics coffee" - is a smart coffee machine integrated in  [Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/).
This project aims to show Robonomics potential in the IoT sphere by a real-world example.

## How to make coffee?

In order to have a cup of delicious coffee, a customer should send some funds (1 Statemine's token 
[ACT](https://statemine.statescan.io/asset/3077), id=3077) to the address of a coffee-machine in Statemine parachain.
After that the pouring process is started and action log is published in the 
[Robonomics parachain](https://parachain.robonomics.network/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmain.frontier.rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/explorer) 
via Datalog function.

## How it works?

There is a single-board computer attached to the body of the coffee machine. This computer is the center of the entire
system, where all the processes are happening. The single-board (Raspberry Pi 4) is connected to the control panel of the 
coffee-machine via jumper breadboard wires and GPIO interface. RPI is also the one interacting with Robonomics and
Statemine parachains. Sample flowchart of the workflow is presented below.

## Tutorial

### Used hardware
- Coffee-machine  
The very important criteria for a coffee-machine was the ability to solder some wires to the control panel since GPIO
was selected as a communication interface being the easiest one to implement. Several options were considered
([Saeco PicoBaristo HD 8925](https://www.philips.com/c-p/SM5478_10R1/picobaristo-super-automatic-espresso-machine),
[De'Longhi ESAM3200.S](https://www.delonghi.com/en/esam3200-s-ex-1-magnifica-automatic-coffee-maker/p/ESAM3200.S%20EX%3A1)). 
As may be seen, no touchscreen and no bells and whistles, just buttons and espresso. Finally,
[Deâ€™Longhi Magnifica ECAM 22.110](https://www.delonghi.com/en/ecam22-110-sb-magnifica-s-automatic-coffee-maker/p/ECAM22.110.SB) 
was chosen as it is cheap and has an easy-removed front panel.
- Single-board [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) (2 GB) with Ubuntu server
installed via [RPi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
- 5V adapter and USB A to USB type C cable ([this](https://www.amazon.com/Charger-FOBSUNLAND-Universal-Adapter-S6-Note/dp/B073Q1N8FL/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?keywords=5v+adapter&qid=1636572682&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExQ1JDSkQ5NlBGTFU2JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODgwMDgzMUJKMU5YVEdXRjdBWCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMTc3NjgwMldDQ1lJWUkwTVY4VSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) and [this](https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Braided-Charging-Compatible-Samsung/dp/B0794M53HQ/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=usb+a+type+c+cable&qid=1636572602&sr=8-1) are examples)
- A set of F-M, M-M, F-F jumper wires, a breadboard (again, [this](https://www.amazon.com/Standard-Jumper-Solderless-Prototype-Breadboard/dp/B07H7V1X7Y/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=breadboard&qid=1636572396&sr=8-13) is just an example).
- Transistor and a resistor(optionally). More on that [later](#4-circuit).

### Tools
- A set of screwdrivers.
- Soldering iron with some solder and resin.
- Multimeter.

### Hardware installation
#### 1. Disassembly the coffee-machine. 
There is a [sample tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y5NCePD0PM) 
on YouTube. Your goal is to remove the front panel (it won't be used anymore, so this is a thing to improve to hide all
the wires) and detach the control PCB.

![Detached PCB](media/detached-pcb.png)

#### 2. Solder two wires to the button you need.
Solder them to the isolated contacts (in our case - two bottom contacts).
You can use any wires, but keep im mind that in the end there should be an M-wire to put it into the breadboard.

![Soldered Wires](media/soldered-wires.png)

#### 3. Assemble the entire coffee-machine back leaving the front panel removed.

![Coffee-machine Overview](media/coffee-machine-overview.png)

#### 4. Circuit  
Overall circuit is presented below, but there is a trick here. The control algorithm of the coffee-machine is pretty 
sensitive to the voltage. So the idea we followed was measuring the potential difference of the contacts of the button
unpressed and then designing a transistor key with 3.3V (GPIO output value) control voltage and **N** *V* load 
voltage where **N** is the potential difference. This tutorial won't go into scheming details, there are methods to 
design transistor keys ([here](https://www.nutsvolts.com/magazine/article/may2015_Secura) and [here](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/transistor/tran_4.html), 
one better use these sources to design a key using the best suitable components),
for our implementation we used R<sub>1</sub>=1k&Omega; , R<sub>2</sub>=30&Omega;, Transistor (*h<sub>fe</sub>*=40,
*U<sub>ce</sub>*>5V, *I<sub>c</sub>*>0.15A ) and a small 3.3V diode in
base circuit found in the storage of our lab:)

#### 5. Connect coffee-machine and RPI
Connect wires marked as *RPI GND* and *RPI GPIO Pin* to pins __ and __ respectively. RPI GPIO scheme is presented below.
Wires marked as *Button+* and *Button-* should be connected to the left button contact and right button contact 
respectively.

![RPI GPIO](media/rpi-gpio.png)

#### 6. Download software
Time to turn the Raspberry Pi into blockchain-powered coffee maker!  
- Prepare the RPI for Substrate libs ([source](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)):
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup default nightly
```
- Install gpiozero library ([source](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing.html)) and reboot:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-gpiozero
sudo pip3 install gpiozero
sudo reboot
```
- Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/robonomics-coffee-maker
```
- Install project requirements
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 7. Account management
On your PC install [Polkadot Extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) and register a coffee-machine account there. **Save 
mnemonic seed phrase as it is going to be used later.**

![Coffee-machine Account](media/account.png)

Logging actions in Robonomics is optional, you will need XRT on 
[parachain.robonomics.network](https://parachain.robonomics.network/) for coffee-machine account (it is the same across
networks) for this. If not, there will simply be an error message *"Balance too low."*

#### 8. Run Robonomics coffee
Run this in repo folder:
```bash
python3 main.py <previously saved seed>
```
You should see the program waiting for ACT incomes:

![Waiting for ACT](media/waiting-for-act.png)

You can send tokens from another account created the same way via `assets:transfer` *extrinsic* on 
[Statemine](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-statemine-rpc.paritytech.net#/explorer).

As soon as there is an income (positive change in `assets:account` *storage function* for address 
derived from seed and for token id `3077`) the RPI triggers GPIO pin 18 and coffee machine starts making coffee!

## Things to point out
- This is a POC of a blockchain-driven IoT device, it has things to improve, wires to hide and functionality to implement
- Token ID, the one, coffee-machine is waiting to receive is edited
[here](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/robonomics-coffee-maker/blob/master/statemine_monitor.py#L27)
- Right now the only thing that matters for income tracker is the positive difference between current and previous
asset balance. This may be filtered [code](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/robonomics-coffee-maker/blob/master/statemine_monitor.py#L59).
